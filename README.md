# container benchmarks

a collection of benchmarks to compare different docker-compattible IoT container platforms and environments

- baseline measurements of performance
    - iozone for disk read/writes
    - STREAM for memory performannce
    - NAS for parallel (CPU) performance
    - ApacheBench for network performance


- container-specific benchmarks
    - spinup time
    - isolation capabilities (noisy neighbour isolation for different configuations)
    -
